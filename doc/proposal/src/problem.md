# Problem Description

We attempt to deanonymize authors and attributing authorship in scientific publications by their writing style through linguistic modeling.

Characterizing individuals through idiosyncratic behavior has further applications in identifying and linking users across online communities as well as detecting fraud by misrepresenting to be someone else (e.g. by overtaking someone's Twitter account).

We choose to focus on attributing authorship in scientific publications since large datasets are more readily available.

We ask questions such as: 
Are double-blind paper submission process really double blind?
Or can we predict authorship of a paper just from the writing style?
Do some scientific (sub)fields have particularly simple or complicated language or are particularly easy or hard for attributing authorship?
