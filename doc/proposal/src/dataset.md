# Datasets

We plan to use scientific publications available through arXiv ($>$900k
submissions total) using Amazon
S3\footnote{\url{http://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data_s3}}. In case we will
need to use a subsample of the data we will use a subset of popular
authors such that we have a history of prior publications for each
scientist.

In parallel, we are also considering to use the ACL
anthology\footnote{\url{http://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/}}, the
scientific publications at PLOS\footnote{\url{http://www.plos.org/}}, or
to obtain publications for a set of authors through Google scholar.

One potential confound of the analysis is that some high profile
publications are edited by technical writers that will likely remove
many linguistic fingerprints by the authors. We expect that this will
only affect a small number of publications in our dataset though.
